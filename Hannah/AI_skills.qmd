# Introduction to LLMs

# The Basics: How to talk to an LLM Chatbot?

## Use search engines vs. LLMs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Search engine

-   A few short keywords
-   Answer: many single results <br><br>
-   Real-time information & news via internet
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### LLM Chatbot

-   Long prompts with lots of details, context, examples & explanations
-   Answer is summarised
-   Answer is statistically probable: prototypical, average, generalized
-   Generalizes across time, no real time-access
:::
:::::

::: notes
LLMs: not ideal for news and up to date knowledge research, better adapted for things that generalize across time (brainstorming, managing projects, creating documents...)
:::

## General tips

-   Use it often and try it out!
-   Speak to it as if it was a person: "Talk into it"
-   Give feedback & engage in dialogue, performance improves very quickly
-   Spelling doesn't matter
-   Use it for the first 80% of your tasks
-   Use microphone & headphones and actually talk!
-   Work on your prompts!

::: notes
Now I want to go through some of these points in more detail with you.
:::

## Voice Control

-   In the ChatGPT App on Mac & Smartphones
-   Otherwise: Chrome extension [Voice Up](https://voicecontrol.chat/) (ChatGPT & Claude)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
### Voice Up

-   Hold SPACE (outside text input) to record, release to submit
-   ESC to stop & transcribe text without submitting
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
### ChatGPT App

## 5 minutes exercise

-   Pick one of the ideas, and try it out.

-   Use voice control to be quicker.

## Effective Prompting

-   **Assign a persona or role**
    -   e.g., PhD student, journalist, psychologist
    -   Specify expertise level
-   **Provide Clear & Extensive Context**
    -   Background of your request
    -   Provide specific details
-   **Provide Specific Examples** (Emails, abstracts etc)
-   Describe constraints: what you don't want

## Effective Prompting

-   **Direct Questions & Instructions**
    -   Clear and concise queries lead to better answers
-   **Start with a Clear Instruction**
    -   e.g., "Help me draft an email to..."
-   **Specify the Desired Format**
    -   Formal tone, length, structure (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs)
-   **Provide feedback to improve the output**

## Exercise: Email (20 minutes)

-   Choose an email you need to write soon
-   Talk to ChatGPT using the microphone
-   Explain who you are, who the email is for
-   Explain the purpose and necessary points to include
-   Tell it to write in the style of the examples you'll give it
-   Tell it to wait for further input
-   Upload 2 emails of you as writing style examples

## Ideas for using it at work

-   **Summarise long documents**: Upload link or file
    -   Instructions from camera, microwave, light panels etc.
    -   Summarise the law ([example laying hens](https://chat.openai.com/c/17233daf-0296-4cad-befb-f0466dfb9375))
    -   Summarise long newspaper articles: listen as a podcast
-   Coaching for important career decisions
-   Recommendations for jobs/positions/roles based on my CV

# Hallucinations

## Hallucinations

-   LLMs invent data that doesn't exist
-   Why? Statistical language prediction.
-   Trained to give an answer, not to be truthful.
-   Does not have fact knowledge or real-time access.
-   Cannot reflect on its own processes
-   New models are much better, but this will continue to happen
-   Can sound very plausible & be hard to recognize

## Strategies for verification

-   4-eyes principle: Model does 80%, 20% human
-   Follow-up questions: Check this again, is it correct? Can you give me some sources? Are you sure?
-   Enter the same prompt in different models and compare, e.g. at <https://poe.com>, <https://anakin.ai>
-   Enter the answer of the 1st model in another model & ask:
    -   Is this correct? Can you please back this up with studies?
-   Sources: use Perplexity

## At work: ideas

-   Statistics questions [Example](https://chatgpt.com/share/670fd64f-cd54-800b-8539-84730cb2414c)
-   Summarise & record workshop & discussions: Run mic
-   Programming: LLMs are data scientists!
    -   Find errors, basic code structure...
    -   Upload data set + related questions
-   Upload long reports/papers, have them analysed
    -   e.g. compare 2 university annual reports, create a table of differences
-   Have transcripts of interviews created

## In the work: Ideas 2

-   Translation [www.deepl.com](www.deepl.com)
-   Productivity coach: screenshot of a diary for a week, or several weeks

## Emotion prompts

-   Emotional expressions can lead to better results ([Cheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emotional_prompt.jpg")
```

```         
Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer. 
You'd better be sure.
```

::: notes
Still relevant? Can enhance both accuracy and depth of response across a variety of tasks. EmotionPrompt, improved performance on complex reasoning tasks such as Instruction Induction and BIG-Bench by up to 8-115%​ ChatGPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5: Despite built-in prompting strategies like chain of thought reasoning, using emotional prompts can still provide added value in tasks requiring empathy or context sensitivity. Practical advice: Testing emotional prompts can help in specific scenarios, like advice or motivational tasks, even though some improvements are already baked into the default model behavior
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### More examples of emotional prompts:

-   This is extremely important to me, please be accurate.
-   If you work correctly and well, you'll get a treat.
-   This is important for my career, please be careful.

## Why do emotional prompts work?

-   Training the model on human language, describing human interactions

-   Is a person's response likely to be better or worse if I tell whom it is important?

-   Can increase care/accuracy of the answer

-   Therefore: Talk like a human being

# Tips for advanced users

## Base or system prompts

-   After a successful interaction, format a base prompt in JSON for future requests:
-   "Please write me a megaprompt so I can do this again next time in JSON"

### Example:

Could you please write a mega prompt from our interaction here, that I can use again next time I want to ask you about coding, when I want a succinct answer? Please write it in JSON.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Base prompt example - Chat GPT response:

{ "request": "Please provide a concise, code-focused answer without basic instructions like how to sign in or navigate interfaces. Assume familiarity with basic concepts and procedures, and focus directly on the commands or steps needed to accomplish the task. In the code, add comments for different code blocks.",

"context": "When asking for coding or technical guidance, I prefer succinct responses that go straight to the point, providing only the essential commands or steps without additional explanations or preliminary steps assumed to be known." }

## Customizing the default version of ChatGPT

-   System prompts\*\*: Prompts that are entered each time, e.g. emotional prompts

# Personal coaching

## Career decisions 

-   Personal example:

    -   decision around leaving academia (long-term) &

    -   Accepting an invitation to give a job talk as assistant professor (short-term)

    ::: notes
    The conversation: <https://chatgpt.com/c/2402017d-b78e-4b2a-8b0b-960ccc2cf0c5>
    :::

## My conversation with an ChatGPT coach  {.scrollable}

-   Context: background, my values and where they (don't) fit with academia, what I like about academia, what is difficult for me, what kind of work-life balance I want in the future, how I want to feel in my next job, which aspects I want it to have, my fears about both paths, why I have not managed to make the decision so far... (\~650 words)

-   Explicit instruction & role: "You are an encouraging and empathetic coach, who helps me take this decision that feels like one of the biggest in my life so far. Don't shy away from being directive and giving advice. "

-   What would you do if you had to decide for me?

-   What are opportunities outside academia where my skills are valued? Which types of roles? Which companies?

-   I also have to make a decision today, without any time to explore other things, about whether I accept the invitation for the interview. What would you do there? Accept or not? Please give a recommendation for a decision, yes or no.

-   CV upload plus: The list of job roles and industry you gave me above was also very useful. Could you adapt the list so it is more personalized after reading my CV and my publication list? I have attached them in a document.

-   It's also important that I can work while living in Vienna, I do not want to move. I prefer working on site. Would you make any adjustments to this list with this knowledge?

-   Please, adjust the list again and include only roles outside of academia that fit me. Can you name specific companies in Vienna? If yes, include them in the list. Also, about the data science roles, I am unsure if they fit well. I am a psychologist who knows to code in R and is really good at statistics. I understand Machine Learning, but have not worked with large datasets myself. I have not written any larger ML project code myself, but worked on one with a Data Science student. What do you think about that?

## Significance for the future

-   The role of AI technologies such as ChatGPT will continue to grow
-   Nature of many jobs will change
-   People who can deal with it creatively and critically are in demand
-   There are no "experts" yet, a "right use"
-   We are constantly learning how best to use them.
-   Keep using & experimenting
